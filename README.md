# SymethricCipher
Example of symethric cypher

The symmethric key cryptography is a one key method used for cipher messages.
the two parts inmersed  in the information exchange must be agree to set the key.
this key will be used to cryp and decryp the messages.
the security is focused on the key.
There is no danger if the attacker know the used algorithm.
Examples of algorithms: DES,3DES,RC5,AES,BLOWFISH,IDEA.
DES is considered insecure becouse of the 56 bit key,3DES is less dangerous than DES.
